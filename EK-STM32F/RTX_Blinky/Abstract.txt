The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for the
ST 'STM32F103VB' microcontroller using 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                   (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM
                   (used for target debugging)
