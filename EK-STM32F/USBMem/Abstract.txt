The Memory project is a demo program for the ST 'STM32F103VB'
microcontroller using 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72 MHz
   - USB clock         = 48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - PC4: LED_RD   is on when USB Device is performing Read access
  - PC5: LED_WR   is on when USB Device is performing Write access
  - PC6: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - PC7: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended


The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.


The Memory program is available for the following targets:

  STM32F103 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
