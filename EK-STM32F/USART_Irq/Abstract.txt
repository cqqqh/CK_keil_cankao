The 'USART_Irq' project is a simple program for the STM32F103VBT6 
using 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
the use of USART1 in interrupt driven mode. Compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - Retargetting is used to read a character and to print out a string.

The Usart program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
