The HID project is a demo program for the ST 'STM32F103VB'
microcontroller using 'EK-STM32F', compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72 MHz
   - USB clock         = 48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs
  - 3 Push Buttons (Key2,Key3), Joystick (Key4)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.


The HID program is available for the following targets:

  STM32F103 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
