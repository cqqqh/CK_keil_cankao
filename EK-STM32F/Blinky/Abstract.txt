The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103VB' 
microcontroller using 'EK-STM32F' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED blinks with speed depending on AD value
 - LCD displays init message and AD value
    TIM4 refreshes LCD  
 - AD conversion is done in DMA mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 (CN2 UART-0)
   - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
